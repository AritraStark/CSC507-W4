REPORT on the findings and performance:
After analyzing the the performance of BFS, DFS(iterative and recursive), Dijkstra's and SCC(1, 2, 3) algorithms
and going through their plotted graphs we can observe prominent trends. These trends can be described as follows: 
For VARN: 
    Time Complexity: 
        1. For small values of N the execution times are nearly 0. 
        2. At N = 900 to 1000 there's a sudden jump in execution time for algorithms. 
        3. SCC3(Tarjan's) has the highest time complexity due to the overhead of multiple DFS traversals. 
    Space Complexity: 
        1. Memory usage scales steadily with increase in N.
        2. Graph shows almost identical pattern in memory usage due to adjacency lists. 
For VARM: 
    Time Complexity: 
        1. Time complexity increases with increase in M, the graph becomes quite chaotic. 
        2. The order of algorithms in best to worst becomes: BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, SCCs. 
        3. For smaller M values the algorithms perform similar and stable. 
    Space Complexity: 
        1. Memory consumption scales linearly with increase in M. 
        2. All algorithms are quite similar due to adjacency lists being the main contributing factor.
